## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.16] - 2026-01-20

### Added
- `@coco.id` encoding options (`slug`, `base64`, `hash`) to produce URL-safe external item IDs.
- Profile source defaults emitted into generated constants for TypeScript and .NET projects (people connectors).
- Validation rules for `@coco.profileSource`/`personAccount` consistency and required `displayName`.

### Changed
- CSV collection parsing now splits on semicolons only.
- `@coco.connection` `connectionDescription` is optional (warning when missing).
- External item payloads always include `id` and `content` (empty content when no `@coco.content`).

### Fixed
- External item ID handling now aligns URL and payload for both content and people connectors.
- People connector item ID handling now preserves the raw CSV value before encoding.

### Breaking Changes
- `@coco.profileSource.displayName` is now required for people connectors.
- Collection values no longer split on commas; use semicolons instead.

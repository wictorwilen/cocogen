# AGENTS.md

This repo contains **gcgen**, an `npx`-runnable generator for Microsoft Graph external connections (Microsoft 365 Copilot connectors).

## Primary goals
- Implement the generator **entirely in TypeScript**.
- Provide a **colorful, pleasant CLI UX** (clear status lines, spinners where appropriate, friendly errors).
- Keep output projects runnable and minimal.

## What the agent should do by default
- Prefer making small, focused changes that keep the repo coherent.
- When something is ambiguous, create a reasonable default and **ask a short follow-up question**.
- Keep documentation and implementation aligned; update docs when behavior changes.
- Maintain **AGENT-TASKS.md** as the living task list:
  - Add new tasks as they are discovered.
  - Mark tasks done when completed.
  - Keep “Now” vs “Later” up to date.

## Source control (smart commits)
- Use **standardized commit messages** and commit when a feature is complete (coherent, tested/validated, and not half-finished).
- Prefer **Conventional Commits** style:
  - `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `docs: ...`, `chore: ...`, `refactor: ...`, `test: ...`
- When the repo is connected to an issue tracker, use **smart commit keywords** in commit messages when appropriate (for example, `fixes #123`).

## Implementation constraints (hard rules)
- **Generator implementation language**: TypeScript only.
  - No C# implementation inside this repo (the generator may emit C# projects later, but the generator itself stays TS).
- **Node runtime**: Node **22 LTS**.
- **Package manager**: `npm`.
- **Module system**: ESM.
- Avoid adding large frameworks unless clearly needed.

## CLI UX guidance
- The CLI should be “colorful” but accessible:
  - Use colors for emphasis (success/warn/error), not for essential meaning.
  - Always work without color (`NO_COLOR=1`) and in CI.
  - Prefer concise progress output; add `--verbose` for detail.
- Suggested libs (subject to confirmation):
  - CLI framework: `commander`.
  - Color: `picocolors` (tiny, fast) or `chalk`.
  - Prompts: `@inquirer/prompts`.
  - Spinners: `ora`.

## Repository structure (intended)
- Keep a single TypeScript codebase for:
  - TypeSpec parsing → IR
  - validation
  - template emission
  - project scaffolding

Start **single-package** (KISS). If/when it grows, split into packages.

## Testing & quality
- Prefer fast unit tests for:
  - TypeSpec → IR mapping
  - validation rules
  - template emission invariants
- Prefer simple snapshot-style tests for emitted file trees.

## Documentation alignment
- Architecture spec lives in docs/architecture.md.
- If implementation deviates, update the spec in the same PR.

## Agent “stop” conditions
- If Microsoft Graph / TypeSpec behavior is unclear and requires confirmation from official docs, pause and ask.
- If a decision changes public CLI behavior, ask for confirmation first.
